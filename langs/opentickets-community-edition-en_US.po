"The tools provided on this page are moderately dangerous, and can cause "
"problems on your site, if you are not absolutely certain you know what you "
"are doing. Marking tickets as taken, without them being associated to an "
"order, technically corrupts your date in a fashion that could be un-"
"repairable. It can also cause certain automated processes in the system, to "
"not function as expected. Furthermore, removing \"reserved\" tickets will "
"remove the tickets from any active carts that contain them. This, at the "
"very least, could cause un-expected customer service issues. In short, use "
"these tools at your own risk."
